# interpreter-practise

This repo has no productive goal. I just practise programming.

Currently, I follow this guide: https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbasi-part1/

I try to implement an interpreter in Python. There are also some exercises in JavaScript. Frist, I tried to reimplement the interpreter with other languages, but (in this specific case) i missed the features of a dynamic typed language.
